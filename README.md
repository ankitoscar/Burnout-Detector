# Project Description


![burnout.jpg](https://blog.easysourceindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Burnout.jpg)

This is a ML based project which helps track the burnout rate of an employee based on the time spent on the web browser working in their job's url. It uses a chrome extension to track the time spent on the work url and uses a simple test and some details to periodically track the burnout rate in an entire work day.

    The objectives of this project:
  - Alarm the user(employee) about the signs of incoming burnout.
  - Integrating technology to help mental health of employees, and of all kinds of users in future.

# Features

  - Although the project is still under development, it will use an extension to track the time spent on websites which will be avaliable on [the Chrome Marketplace](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).
  - We also aspire to add some features to make sure the prediction is more accurate and requires less input from the user's side.


# Data

  - The data is taken from the [Hackerearth competition on kaggle about employee burnout](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-predict-burnout-rate/), which involved predict the burnout rate of an employee based on details provided by them.
  -  The data involves the following features in it.

### Tech

The libraries and frameworks used in this project till now are:

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Used for data analysis
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - Awesome mathematical library for python
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - For data visualization.
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - For implementing ML algorithms.
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) - For making python notebook.
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) - For making web application.


In future we will add more features, hence other tech used in the project will be also mentioned.

### To Dos

 - Improve the model.
 - Create an interactive UI and build a real-time prediction mechanism through the Chrome Extension.
 - Take inputs without requiring the user to explicitly enter them.
 - Deploy the extension on marketplace.
